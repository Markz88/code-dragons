# Code & Dragons

**Code & Dragons** is an educational RPG that turns Python programming exercises into quests, character progression, and rewards.  
The project consists of:  
- a **FastAPI backend** that safely evaluates user-submitted code in a sandbox, and  
- a **vanilla JavaScript frontend** that provides the game interface via static pages.  

---

## ✨ Features
- **Story-driven progression** with chapters and levels defined in JSON, including narrative prompts and automated tests.  
- **Character creation** with roles, avatars, XP bar, dynamic achievements, and rewards.  
- **Game world extensions** such as a compendium, shop, and side quests served as additional static pages.  
- **Portable saves**: export and import local progress files (`*.pqs`) directly from the interface.  
- **Secure execution mode**: the backend uses `sandbox.py` to filter ASTs, block imports, and log test failures.  

---

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **`backend/`** – FastAPI app (`app.py`), JSON definitions for levels and achievements, execution sandbox, and Python dependencies.  
- **`frontend/`** – HTML/CSS/JS interface served as static files by the backend (`/static`). Includes avatar assets and pages for the compendium, shop, and side missions.  
- **`Dockerfile`** – Multi-stage build based on Python 3.12 that packages both backend and frontend.  

---

## 📦 Requirements
- Python 3.11+ (Python 3.12 recommended)  
- `pip` (virtual environments are optional but recommended)  
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)  

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Development)

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

Open the game at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).  

### Run with Docker
```bash
docker build -t code-and-dragons .
docker run --rm -p 5000:8000 code-and-dragons
```
Replace 5000 with the port you want to use (e.g., 3000:8000, 5000:8000, etc.).
The game will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) (replace 5000 with the host port you mapped).

## 🎨 Customizing Content
- Add new levels or chapters in `backend/levels.json` by updating the `meta.order` key and defining tests.  
- Manage achievements, roles, and supporting story elements in `backend/achievements.json`.  
- Update or add avatars, icons, and other assets in `frontend/assets/`.  
- To enable bug reporting via email, edit `frontend/app.js` and update the line:
  ```js
  const REPORT_EMAIL = 'support@example.com';
  ```

> ⚠️ Remember to restart the development server after modifying JSON files to reload the data.

## 🛤️ Roadmap
- Add full English language support  
- Expand avatar set: provide 10 different avatars per role
- (Open to suggestions!)
